# ðŸ’« About Me:
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Yunes Maghsoudie, a self-taught Front-End Developer with 2+ years of experience building modern, responsive, and production-ready web applications.  

I specialize in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, with a strong focus on clean UI, performance optimization, and scalable architecture. My journey began with Python and PHP/Laravel, but I found my passion in the JavaScript ecosystem, where Iâ€™ve worked on both freelance and professional projects.  

Currently, Iâ€™m working at Happy Trainers as a Front-End Developer, where I build responsive features with React and Next.js, integrate AI-powered tools, and optimize backend performance by migrating from Firebase to Supabase. Previously, Iâ€™ve worked as a Front-End Intern at BrandAfraz, and as a freelancer on Ponisha & Karlancer delivering client projects.  

ðŸŒŸ What I Do:  
- Develop reusable and scalable components with React and Next.js (SSR, SSG, ISR, CSR)  
- Build responsive, accessible, and user-friendly UIs with TailwindCSS  
- Manage state with Context API, useReducer, and design patterns like Pub-Sub  
- Apply MVC architecture and clean code principles for maintainability  
- Integrate APIs and databases using Supabase and Firebase  
- Deploy production-ready apps on Vercel and optimize for performance  

ðŸ§  Development Philosophy:  
I believe great code should be both developer-friendly and user-friendly. My focus is always on writing maintainable solutions, following design patterns, and collaborating with UI/UX to create seamless experiences. Iâ€™m constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and building projects like Taste Hub, NutriPlan, and Glow Cards to push my skills further.
