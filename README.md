# üí´ About Me:
Me<br><br>üëã Hi! I‚Äôm **Yones Maghsoudie**, a passionate **front-end web developer** from Shiraz, Iran. While I focus on front-end development, I‚Äôm currently learning **Vue.js** to expand my skillset into more advanced front-end frameworks. I started my coding journey with **Python** and have since gained experience in **PHP, Laravel, Assembly, C#**, and **JavaScript**, which is now my main focus. I'm **hardworking** and constantly pushing myself to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest in web development.<br><br>üåü What I Do:<br>I specialize in **front-end development**, building structured, maintainable, and efficient web applications using **MVC architecture**. I make use of **design patterns** like **Facade** and **Publisher-Subscriber** to ensure scalability and maintainability in my code. With a deep respect for **users‚Äô time**, my projects, such as **Taste Hub**, are focused on providing **valuable and relevant content**.<br><br>üí° My Projects:<br>One of my key projects is **Taste Hub**, a web platform where users can explore recipes and articles about food and drinks. It pulls data from **Forkify API** and **The Cocktail DB API**, delivering a smooth user experience with an emphasis on content **value**. My goal is to always ensure that users get exactly what they need without wasting their time.<br><br>Check it out here: [Taste Hub](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/recipes)<br><br>üß† Development Philosophy:<br>I strive to write **clean, maintainable code**, utilizing **MVC architecture** and **design patterns** to make sure my projects are easy to maintain and extend. What I love most about web development is the ability to **create new things** and **solve problems**. I believe in delivering **user-friendly solutions** that are also **developer-friendly**‚Äîclear, organized, and scalable.<br><br>üí¨ Shoutouts:<br>Throughout my journey, several tools, communities, and people have been instrumental in shaping my path as a developer:<br>- Tools: **TailwindCSS**, **Vite**, and **Axios** have been vital in my development workflow.<br>- Communities: I‚Äôve learned and grown thanks to platforms like **GitHub**, **Stack Overflow**, **Telegram channels**, and **Roocket.ir**.<br>- People: A special thanks to **Jonas Schmedtmann**, whose courses on Udemy helped me master JavaScript, and **Armin Hooshmand**, who guided me through learning **TailwindCSS**, **PHP**, and **Laravel**.
